## Algorithms

### Pathfinders

**A\*:** arguably the best algorithm used in path-finding and graph traversals. A\* uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path and achieves optimality and completeness.

### Mazes

**Random:** Randomly generated walls

**Recursive:** A recursive backtracker algorithm - probably the most widely used algorithm for maze generation.
